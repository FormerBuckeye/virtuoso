//   to that syscall, and n is the length of that buffer, taken as the "n_arg_num"'th argument 
//   to the syscall.  "buff_name" is a name for the buffer.  
//   If "[proc]" exists, only label for this process.

// If "rw"=read then only label reads.  If "rw"=write then only label writes.
// Can be restricted by process.
