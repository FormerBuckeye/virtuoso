1. Control-flow dependencies [Principled] [DONE]
    - Look at system dependence graphs
    - Look at program dependence graphs

2. Memory allocation [HACK] [85%]
    - Write before read => dynamic allocation
    - Set A0 to new non-conflicting address
        - Do not derive; eliminates deps
    - Hmm, side effect? May move the stack
        - That's probably okay
    - BZZT. Doesn't work this way.
    - Instead, use domain knowledge of memory allocating functions

3. Aliasing (multiple VAs map to same PA) [HACK] [0%]
    - Similar approach: force A0 so that all access
      to the buffer goes through the same virtual
      address
    - Just used domain knowledge here too.
