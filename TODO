1. Control-flow dependencies [Principled]
    - Look at system dependence graphs
    - Look at program dependence graphs
2. Memory allocation [HACK]
    - Write before read => dynamic allocation
    - Set A0 to new non-conflicting address
        - Do not derive; eliminates deps
    - Hmm, side effect? May move the stack
        - That's probably okay
3. Aliasing (multiple VAs map to same PA) [HACK]
    - Similar approach: force A0 so that all access
      to the buffer goes through the same virtual
      address
