1. Get the required dependencies for QEMU. In debian, this can be done
   with:
    apt-get build-dep qemu 

2. Downlaod and install libdasm from
    http://code.google.com/p/libdasm/

3. Enter iferret-logging-new and execute:
    ./cleanup.sh
    make install
    make -f Makefile-iferretso

   This should place the logging-enabled QEMU binary in the install/bin
   directory.
